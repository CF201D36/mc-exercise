<!-- "This is what Bob & Carol did on Bob's computer when working on the first feature" -->
So, a skeleton walks into a bar. He says to the bartender "I'd like a shot of whiskey... and a mop."
Schrodinger's Cat walks into a bar... and he *doesn't*. 

I really wish Alice wasn't working with me. She smells like ass.

<!-- Carol and Ted added another FEATURE  -->
Chuh chuch chuch chuh changes!
